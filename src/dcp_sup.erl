%% canonicalized list which is encoded into the replicator names (child ID).
%% Whenever features become eligible to be turned on or disabled, this list
%% would differ in its content thereby signalling the supervisor to drop
%% existing connections and recreate them with appropriate features enabled.
%% This could mean that the ongoing rebalance can fail and we are ok with that
%% as it can be restarted.
